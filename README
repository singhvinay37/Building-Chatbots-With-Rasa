Problem Statement:
------------------

An Indian startup named 'Foodie' wants to build a conversational bot (chatbot) which can help users discover restaurants across several Indian cities. 
The main purpose of the bot is to help users discover restaurants quickly and efficiently and to provide a good restaurant discovery experience.

Important Notes: 
----------------

Assume that Foodie works only in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities. You can use the current HRA classification of the cities from here. 
Under the section 'current classification' on this page, the table categorizes cities as X, Y and Z. Consider 'X ' cities as tier-1 and 'Y' as tier-2. 
The bot should be able to identify common synonyms of city names, such as Bangalore/Bengaluru, Mumbai/Bombay etc. 


Foodie Chatbot built using RASA. Data is fetched using zomato api functions & link is provided below-

base_url = "https://developers.zomato.com/api/v2.1/"
